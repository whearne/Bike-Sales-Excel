# Bike Sales Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of bike sales data through an interactive Excel-based dashboard. The dashboard helps visualize key metrics such as customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and commute patterns, allowing stakeholders to gain insights and make informed decisions.

## Dashboard Features

The Bike Sales Dashboard offers insights into:

- **Average Income Per Purchase**: A bar chart showing the average income of customers based on their gender and whether or not they purchased a bike.
- **Customer Age Brackets**: A line chart breaking down customers into three age groups: adolescents (0-30), middle-aged (31-54), and older adults (55+). It highlights the purchase patterns of each age group.
- **Customer Commute**: A line chart that represents how far customers commute, ranging from 0-1 miles to over 10 miles. It compares the bike-purchasing habits of customers with different commute distances.

### Filters
The dashboard includes interactive filters, allowing you to slice the data based on:

- **Marital Status**: Filter between married and single customers.
- **Region**: Analyse bike sales in Europe, North America, or the Pacific.
- **Education**: Segment data based on customers' education levels (Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, Partial College, and Partial High School).

## Installation

## Insights from the Dashboard

- **Income vs. Gender**: The data suggests that male customers, on average, have a higher income per purchase compared to female customers.
- **Age and Purchasing Trends**: Middle-aged customers (31-54) form the largest age group of bike purchasers, whereas adolescents and older adults show lower levels of bike purchasing.
- **Commute Distance**: Customers who commute shorter distances (0-1 miles) tend to purchase bikes more frequently compared to those who commute longer distances.
